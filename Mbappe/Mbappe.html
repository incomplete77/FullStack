	<p><b>Kylian Mbappé Lottin</b> (born 20 December 1998) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward
		for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the France national team. Considered one of the best players in the
		world, he is renowned for his dribbling abilities, exceptional speed, and finishing.</p>
	<p>Born in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy, Mbappé began his senior club career in 2015 playing for Monaco, where
		he won the Ligue 1 title. In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent
		transfer worth €180 million, making him the second-most-expensive player and most expensive teenage player.[4]
		There, he has won four Ligue 1 titles, three Coupes de France and is the club's second-highest all-time top
		goalscorer. He helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season and led the club to its first ever
		Champions League Final.</p>
	<p>At international level, Mbappé made his senior debut for France in 2017, at age 18. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup,
		Mbappé became the youngest French player to score at a World Cup, and became the second teenager, after Pelé, to
		score in a World Cup Final. He finished as the joint second-highest goalscorer as France won the tournament, and
		won the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player and French Player of the Year for his performances. At the 2022 FIFA
		World Cup, France reached the final; Mbappé won the Golden Boot and Silver Ball and set the record for most
		goals scored in World Cup finals.</p>
	<p>Mbappé was named to the FIFA FIFPro World11 in 2018 and 2019, the UEFA Team of the Year in 2018 and the UEFA
		Champions League Squad of the Season in 2016–17, 2019–20, 2020–21 and 2021–22. He was awarded the Globe Soccer
		Best Player of the Year in 2021. He has won the Golden Boy in 2017, Ligue 1 Player of the Year three times, and
		has finished as the Ligue 1 top scorer for four seasons; in the 2021–22 season, he became the first player to
		finish as both Ligue 1 top scorer and top assist provider.</p>
